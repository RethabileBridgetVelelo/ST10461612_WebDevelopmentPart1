<h1 align="center">Flagellar Motor Web Project</h1>

<p align="center">
  A web-based educational and interactive platform for exploring the science and technology behind flagellar motor detection.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>🌐 Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  This project was developed as part of a web development assignment. It aims to educate users about flagellar motors in bacterial cells, integrating advanced topics like Cryogenic Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) and Machine Learning (ML). 
</p>
<p>
  The platform includes multiple pages such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Homepage</strong> (index.html)</li>
  <li><strong>AI Chatbot</strong> – Ask questions and get instant responses</li>
  <li><strong>Datasets & Tools</strong> – Learn about resources used in flagellar research</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive Demo</strong> – Simulate or view animations of the flagellar mechanism</li>
  <li><strong>Explore Research</strong> – Dive into current scientific literature and experiments</li>
  <li><strong>Contact Page</strong> – For user queries or contributions</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>CSS3 (basic)</li>
  <li>JavaScript (optional integration in future)</li>
</ul>
